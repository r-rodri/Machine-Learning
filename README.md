This project aims to describe the applicability of unsupervised and supervised learning methods and the creation of a database dashboard about a banking campaign.

Classification methods were used to identify customers who subscribed to a certain product and a comparison of different linear regression methods was also made on two characteristics of this database. 
Grouping and association techniques were also used to identify different sets of customers.

The objective of this study is to compare the implementation of different machine learning techniques, and conclude about the results and limitations on the applied models.
